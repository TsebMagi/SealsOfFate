You must sign a Contribution License Agreement (CLA) before your PR will be
merged. This a one-time requirement for A Legitimate Business, LLC projects in GitHub. You can read more about [Contribution License Agreements (CLA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) on Wikipedia.

However, you don't have to do this up-front. You can simply clone, fork, and submit your pull-request as usual.

Signing the CLA is not terrifying and can be done in a small amount of time. Ideally, you'd have access to a PDF reader/editor that allows for signing. If not, take a photo of the signature page and email it to <jeremiah@legit.biz>.

The Individual Contributor Agreement can be found in [Individual Contributor Agreement.pdf](https://github.com/legitbiz/SealsOfFate/blob/jp-contributor-agreement/Individual%20Contributor%20Agreement.pdf)
