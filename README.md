Seals of Fate is a prototype rogue-like built in the Unity engine using C#. 

## Setup instructions

1. The game is being actively developed in the latest version of the Unity game engine . Unity v5.6 or later is required to open and run the project.

1. Clone this repository into a directory on your local machine.

1. Open the Unity editor and choose open project in the splash page. Navigate to where you cloned the repository and open the entire folder.

1.  To play, hit the play arrow in the center-top of the screen.

## How to Play

Move with the arrow keys. Play moves in short turn-steps, after each move, all enemies and other entities in the game world move after each of your moves. To attack an enemy, move into them. Collecting fish restores HP.

## Planned Features
A sample of some of the planned features is below, but for full details, see waffle or the issue tracker.

### Upcoming

* Fast, Medium, and Slow speeds, where faster creatures can take turns more often.
* Placeholder win and loss conditions
* Combat UI

### On the Horizon

* Skills and ranged attacks
* Status Effects
* Basic loot system

### Long Term

* Hat-based class system
* Lore books
* More puns than good taste really would reccomend
* Boss enemies
* Multiple Levels
* Much more!

## Status

* Project-Wide issues are on [Waffle.io](http://waffle.io/legitbiz/SealsOfFate) and on the [github issues page](https://github.com/legitbiz/SealsOfFate/issues).

* AI specific issues and project status can be found on the [github kanban board](https://github.com/Zonr0/SealsOfFate/projects/1) on the AI fork. If there is a conflict between the two project boards, the project-wide ones take precedence.

### Overview
Currently, focus is on implementing MVP features in order to create a playable prototype with all basic features by the end of August. Right now, a single level is procedurally generated with enemies and food pickups. We have basic combat in with the frameworks for designing and implementing new attacks.
