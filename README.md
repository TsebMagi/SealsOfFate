## Planned Features


## Status

* Project-Wide issues are on [Waffle.io](http://waffle.io/legitbiz/SealsOfFate) and on the [github issues page](https://github.com/legitbiz/SealsOfFate/issues).

* AI specific issues and project status can be found on the [github kanban board](https://github.com/Zonr0/SealsOfFate/projects/1) on the AI fork. If there is a conflict between the two project boards, the project-wide ones take precedence.

### Overview
Currently, focus is on implementing MVP features in order to create a playable prototype with all basic features by the end of August. Right now, a simple 8x8 room is procedurally generated around the player along with a few enemies who have a limited ability to follow the player around.
