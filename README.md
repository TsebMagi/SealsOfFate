## Overview

Seals of Fate is a prototype rogue-like built in the Unity engine using C#. Currently it contains one procedurally generated level with enemies and food pickups. It has basic combat in with the framework implemented to design more complex attacks.

## Setup instructions

1. The game is being actively developed in the latest version of the Unity game engine . Unity v5.6 or later is required to open and run the project.

1. Clone this repository into a directory on your local machine.

1. Open the Unity editor and choose open project in the splash page. Navigate to where you cloned the repository and open the entire folder.

1.  To play, hit the play arrow in the center-top of the screen.

## How to Play

Move with the arrow keys. Play moves in short turn-steps, after each move, all enemies and other entities in the game world move after each of your moves. To attack an enemy, move into them. Collecting fish restores HP.

To win, defeat all penguins in the level. If all your HP reaches 0, you die and lose.
